<h1>Programming Framework for Microcontrollers</h1>
</div>

Aixt is a programming framework for microcontrollers which uses a modern language syntax based on [_V_](https://vlang.io/) and able to be used by low-resource devices. Aixt is composed by 3 main components:

- The **Aixt** programming language based on the [_V language_](https://vlang.io/) syntax.
- The **Aixt to C Transpiler**, which translate the **Aixt** source code to _C_, for the specific _C_ compiler of each microcontroller.
- The **Aixt API**, which makes the programming easy by standardizing the setup and I/O functions.  

This diagram shows the Aixt blocks and their interactions:

    }

```

Aixt is designed as modular as possible to facilitate the incorporation of new devices and boards. This is mainly possible by using a configuration file (in TOML format) instead of creating new source code for each new device. That `.TOML` file contains the specific parameters of each device, board or compiler such as: variable types, initialization commands, compiler paths, etc.


## Aixt to C Transpiler

The transpiler is written in [_V_](https://vlang.io/) and uses _V's_ native compiler facilities to transpile from _V_ to _C_. This is implemented in the folders `\aixt_build` and `\aixt_cgen`, and the main source code is the `aixt.v` file. It generates code for 3 different backends:
- **c**: for the microcontroller native C compiler
- **nxc**: for the NXC compiler (LEGO Mindstorms NXT)
- **arduino**: for the Arduino IDE **WIP...**


## Aixt Language

**Aixt** programing language implements a subset of the [_V language_](https://vlang.io/). The main differences are show as follows:

feature                       | V                                       | Aixt
------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------
variables                     | immutable by default                    | mutable by default
strings                       | dynamic-sized                           | dynamic-sized (only if supported)
arrays                        | dynamic-sized                           | dynamic-sized (only if supported)
default integers size         | 32 bits                                 | depends on the device  
structs                       | allow functions (object-oriented)       | don't allow functions (only structured)
functions                     | multiple return values                  | only one return value
C-style preprocessor commands | only V specific ones and `#include`     | support any command starting with `#`
`C.functions()`               | need to explicitly include the C file   | auto include `function.c` for `C.function()`


### Example with `main` function

```v
/* Turning ON by 5.5 seconds the onboard LED 10 in the Explorer16 
board with a PIC24FJ microcontroller (XC16 compiler) */
import time { sleep_ms }
import pin { high, low }

fn main() {
    high(led10)    //turn ON the LED 10 (PORTA7)
    sleep_ms(5500)
    low(led10)
}
```

### Example without `main` function (Script mode)

```v
// Blinking LEDs on the Seeeduino XIAO-SAM21 board (Arduino backend)
import time
import pin

pin.setup(2, pin.output)
pin.setup(3, pin.output)

for i in 0 .. 10 { // 10 times
	pin.high(2)
	time.sleep_ms(250)
	pin.low(2)
	time.sleep_ms(250)
}

for {
	pin.high(3)
	time.sleep(1)
	pin.low(3)
	time.sleep(2)
}
```

## Aixt API

The **Aixt API** is inspired by _Micropython_, _Arduino_ and _Tinygo_. The API for all the ports includes at least functions for:

- Digital input/output
- Analog inputs (ADC)
- PWM outputs
- Serial port (UART)

## Using Aixt

### Installing Aixt from source
```
git clone https://github.com/fermarsan/aixt.git
cd aixt
make # make.bat on Windows
```
### Running Aixt
run it in a Linux-based system as:
```
./aixt <command> <device_or_board> <source_file>
```
or in Windows:
```
aixt.exe <command> <device_or_board> <source_file>
```

### Running examples:

```
./aixt -t Emulator test.v
```
```
./aixt -b NXT ports/NXT/projects/1_motor_forward.v
```

## Project's name

The project's name is inspired in _Veasel_, the Weasel pet of _V Language_, and at the same time is a tribute to _Ticuna_ people who live in the Amazon forest between the borders of _Colombia_, _Brasil_ and _Perú_. Weasels are _mustelids_ just like otters, so the name **Aixt** comes from _Aixtü_, which is a way to say otter in [_Ticuna_](https://www.sil.org/system/files/reapdata/90/20/51/90205190508691852389084667097660892450/tca_Ticuna_Dictionary_2016_web.pdf) language.
